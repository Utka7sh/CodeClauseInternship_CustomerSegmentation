This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Project Overview
In this project, we use K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. The dataset used in this project contains information about customers' age, annual income, and spending score.

## Files Included

- `CustomerSegmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `Customer_Segmentation.html`: HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results, you need the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- plotly
